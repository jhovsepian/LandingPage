        Hello there, my name is Jacqueline Hovsepian. I am a 10th grader that attends Pasadena High School. This is my second year of coding, in these two years
        I have learned about HTML, CSS, PHP, and JAVASCRIPT. Coding is a wonderful experience and I think you should try it. You get to make websites 
        and games! Thanks for visiting my Landing Page!
